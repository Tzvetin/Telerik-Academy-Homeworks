This past weekend, YouTube hosted its first-ever music awards show as a self-congratulatory nod to the role it's played this past decade in facilitating the breakthroughs of our most famous pop stars and novelty-hit atrocities alike. But for music fans who came of age in the pre-internet era, the site has served a more practical, psychologically mollifying function: It’s helped verify the occurrence of events that, for decades, we thought we had simply hallucinated.

For instance, thanks to YouTube, one can confirm that: a) Joan Rivers did indeed have a late-night talk show in the 80s; b) Suzanne Somers was its occasional fill-in host; and c) one night in 1987, U.K. post-punk godheads Wire were her musical guests. They didn’t even perform their accessible dance-rock crossover single of the time, “Ahead”, but the impenetrable, pummelling The Ideal Copy bonus track “Drill.” And instead of just offering up a simple post-performance wave and handshake, Somers actually tried to engage the notoriously stoic group in egreiously idle chit-chat as if she were still hanging at the Regal Beagle. The clip stands as a time capsule of alternative rock’s painfully awkward early encounters with the mainstream, and even today, when indie bands can seemingly go from Bandcamp to Letterman in a mouse-click, it’s hard to imagine such a deviously dissonant anti-pop gesture being allowed to play out anywhere near a network-television soundstage. But if there is to ever be another underground-spawned art-punk band to find itself enduring awkward small talk with a television host, my money is on Brooklyn’s Yvette.

Yvette are a two-piece band, but sound like an army—both in their blitzkrieged aggression and the militaristically disciplined manner in which they deploy it. They’re an industrial act in the truest sense of the term, transforming scabrous raw materials into beautiful, glistening, chrome-plated objects that cast an uncanny allure. Theirs is a noise molded into the contours—if not the sound—of pop music, offering an accessible entry point into a world of ugly brutalism. But if Yvette approach their music with assembly-line precison and expediency, their output is hardly identi-kit. Process, their full-length debut, may list 11 tracks on its artwork, however, those markers seem almost arbitrary; rather, the album feels like a series of fragmented outbursts compacted together into a 33-minute piece that frequently shifts course and reanimates into new shapes without warning, often within a span of a single song.
